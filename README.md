# NoHunger
A Minecraft Spigot plugin that disables hunger depletion.

Commands:
- /togglehunger - Toggle your hunger on/off

Permissions:
- nohunger.toggle - Allows player to toggle their hunger. Without this, none of the hunger-disabling effects will work. 

If player has permission to toggle, they will also receive a message displaying their hunger toggle status upon join. This can be disabled in config.yml.

All messages can be edited, using standard minecraft colour codes, in config.yml.
